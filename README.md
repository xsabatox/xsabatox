## About Me

I'm Victor. I'm a [journeyman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journeyman "A skilled worker, but not a master craftsman yet.") developer. I'm  also a biologist with a master's in ecology and conservation biology. I feel passionate about learning and love to geek out about all things tech related, specially vintage tech.

## Programming journey

My first programming experience was as a kid back in the 1990's, creating my first website with plain HTML using [Microsoft FrontPage Express 2.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_FrontPage). In the 2010's I've started learning scripting with [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) during my graduate course so I could analyze my data. Some time later I've also played with scripting while macroing on Ultima Online using [EasyUO](http://www.easyuo.com/). Then I took Dr. Chuck's [Python 4 Everybody](https://www.py4e.com/) course on Coursera. In the 2020's, during the COVID-19 pandemic, I went to [vocational school](https://www.fiemg.com.br/curso/curso-tecnico-em-desenvolvimento-de-sistemas/) and got a Systems Developer technician degree. Most recently, I've joined [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) to hone my skills.
